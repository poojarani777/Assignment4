    <h1>Collaboration Skills</h1>
    <p>Collaboration skills are what enable you to work well with others. Most work environments require collaboration,
        so these skills are essential. These skills include understanding a variety of perspectives, managing priorities
        from everyone in the group, and meeting expectations as a reliable member of a team.

        Successful collaboration requires a cooperative spirit and mutual respect. Employers typically seek employees
        that function effectively as part of a team and are willing to balance personal achievement with group goals.

        Alternate names: Teamwork skills, team building skills</p>
    
        <h2>How Collaboration Skills Work</h2>
        The idea of collaboration seems easy enough, but in reality, it can be challenging to collaborate with others.
        Each person on a team has strengths and weaknesses, communication preferences, and personal goals. Company
        culture also influences collaboration. Some companies value collaboration and provide training on how to
        collaborate, while others assume that collaboration will naturally happen.

       <h3>Using collaboration skills within a team may include:</h3>

       <ul><li> Keeping communication open and never withholding information necessary to carry out tasks</li>
       <li> Reaching a consensus about goals and methods for completing projects or tasks</li>
        <li>Offering recognition of the contributions of others on your team, giving credit where credit is due</li>
        <li>Identifying obstacles and addressing problems cooperatively as they occur</li>
       <li> Placing group goals above personal satisfaction and/or recognition, especially if you're the leader</li>
       <li> Apologizing for missteps and forgiving others for mistakes</li>
    </ul>
