    <h1>Creativity and Innovation</h1>
    <p>In most situations, innovation is flexible thinking that results in measurable
        outcomes. Some organizations have begun using a methodology called design thinking to help drive innovation on
        their
        teams and help find a common vocabulary for the process of developing new ideas and processes. Whichever
        language
        your team uses to discuss innovation, the ability to apply original or unique problem-solving processes to your
        challenges can help you succeed.
    </p>
    <h2>Innovation</h2>
    <p>Creativity usually refers to the act of generating new ideas itself, regardless of whether those ideas result in
        measurable outcomes or solutions. Thinking creatively can be a very important part of innovation because
        thinking creatively can help you identify new ways to do things and create tangible products that contribute to
        innovative measurable outcomes.</p>
    <h2> creativity and innovation examples</h2>
    <p></p>
</body>Creativity and innovation work together to create a solution to a problem or bring a new experience to society.
The following list Here are seven creative innovations:
<h2>Ride hailing</h2>
<p>The introduction of ride hailing produced a new vehicle-for-hire transportation service that was initially
    controlled by taxicabs. The first company to offer this service creativity conceptualized ride hailing and
    contractor-based individual driving systems to make flexible job opportunities and vehicle for hire access quicker
    and more affordable. The initial innovation facilitated the creation of similar services by other companies.
<h2>Automobiles</h2>
Before the automobile, there were horse-drawn carriages, trollies and trains. The inventors of the automobile saw a
need for faster personalized transportation. The automobile forever changed the way people travel. The innovation of
the first automobile fueled subsequent innovations.
<h2>Chiaroscuro</h2>
In art, chiaroscuro is a method of expression using sharp contrasts between darkness and light to create a unique
atmosphere and composition. The person who created this idea wanted to invent a creative process for producing more
realistic imagery and a sense of three-dimensional volume. In this vein, their creativity lead to an actual
technique that other artists could use to generate the same or similar effect.
<h2>Search engines</h2>
Internet search engines are one of the most well-known examples of contemporary innovation. Thanks to the
conceptualization of a space that offers a much broader online experience for consumers, search engines became one
of the leading tools of technological and internet information acquisition. Search engines function as knowledge
base search systems, streamlining the capacity for human learning.
<h2>Cellphones</h2>
The global success of the cellphone changed the way people communicate. Before the cellphone, people relied on
landlines and other methods of communication. This made communication not always readily accessible and confined
someone to a specific location if they wanted to talk with other people. The creators of the cellphone saw a need
for mobile communication and conceptualized the idea of a phone that was not confined to a cord. Though the
cellphone went through many iterations over the years, it eventually led to the small portable device that exists
today. Cellphones continue to evolve from modern era innovations and ideas.
<h2>Erasable pens</h2>
Before the erasable pen, pens provided a permanent mark on your writing medium. This meant that a person unsatisfied
with their work had to use whiteout or scratch through what they wanted to change. The inventor of this product saw
a need for a solution to this issue and created a pen that could erase like a pencil.
