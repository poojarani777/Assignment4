    <h1>Adaptive Thinking</h1>
    <p>In 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War, US Navy fighter pilots started losing ground to their North Vietnamese
        counterparts.

        During the previous few years, US fighter pilots had been shooting down about two North Vietnamese aircraft for
        every one they lost, a 2:1 ratio. But by the first few months of 1968, the ratio had dropped to 1:1.

        This was the impetus for the creation of the famous Top Gun school that took the best US Navy fighter pilots,
        trained them to fly and fight like enemy fighter pilots, and used them as instructors for new Navy fighter
        pilots.

        The results of the Top Gun training program were impressive: By the early 1970s, US Navy fighter pilots were
        shooting down just over 12 enemy aircraft for every one they lost, a dramatically improved 12:1 ratio.

        Critically, the success of the Top Gun training program lay in its rigorous application of the principles of
        Deliberate Practice, especially, a specific approach to the mental aspects of high-performance called Adaptive
        Thinking.</p>
    <h2>Examples of adaptive skills</h2>
    <p>
        There are different adaptive skills you can build to help you find continued success in any workplace. These
        skills can follow you down any career path and help you transition to many forms of success. It can thus greatly
        benefit you to be:

    <ul>
        <li>Collaborative</li>
        <li>Open to new learning opportunities</li>
        <li>Innovative</li>
        <li>Open-minded</li>
        <li>Determined</li>
        <li>Empathetic</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How Adaptive Thinking Leads to High Performance</h2>
    <p>According to psychologist and expertise researcher Anders Ericsson, Adaptive Thinking involves the ability to
        “recognize unexpected situations, quickly consider various possible responses, and decide on the best one.”

        As you might expect, this ability is critical for high-stakes performance like fighter pilots in a dogfight.

        While most people with adequate levels of skill and competency can usually perform well in routine
        circumstances, it’s the ability to perform at a high level under unpredictable or stressful circumstances that
        often sets apart truly expert performers.

        Think of the neurosurgeon who can adapt on the fly to an unexpected brain bleed in the middle of a procedure or
        the trial lawyer who can deftly modify their argument and strategy in the face of unexpected evidence or
        testimony.

        The ability to perform well at the highest levels requires the ability not only to think well but to think
        flexibly and quickly—in other words, to think adaptively.

        Interestingly, some clever research into how high-performing professionals work has identified 3 primary
        components or ingredients of Adaptive Thinking:

        Effective planning
        Careful monitoring of progress
        The ability to flexibly shift thinking and behavior to accommodate circumstantial changes
        In the rest of this article, we’ll look at how you can use 3 specific exercises to improve Adaptive Thinking and
        bolster your performance in any area.

        How to Improve Your Adaptive Thinking
        Adaptive Thinking isn’t just for fighter pilots and neurosurgeons. Anyone can learn to harness the power of
        Adaptive Thinking to improve their performance in any domain that matters to them.

        Whether you want to become more proficient in playing guitar, closing a sale, investing in startups, or
        communicating with your spouse, exercising your Adaptive Thinking abilities will help you go from merely okay or
        adequate to excelling.

        Each of these exercises is based on one of the three ingredients of Adaptive Thinking—Planning, Monitoring, and
        Cognitive Flexibility. If you can practice them consistently, you’ll be well on your way to dramatically
        improved performance.</p>
