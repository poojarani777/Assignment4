    <h1>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Skills</h1>
    <p>Critical thinking is the process to rationally analyze and attempt to solve a problem – accurately and
        efficiently. This method is made without the use of guesses and assumptions.

        It is a cognitive skill or a mental process. Based on acquired knowledge, you’ll have to analyze, examine, and
        scrutinize options to create an opinion or set of actions.

        Business leaders use critical thinking to solve day-to-day problems. On the other hand, students rely on
        critical thinking for their learning process and research.

        It is the ability to think rationally and clearly, while understanding the connection between opinions and
        ideas.

    <h2> Enhancing Critical Thinking Skills</h2>

    <ol><li>Never take anything as is. Don’t accept things at face value. Always learn to evaluate every single data you are
        getting. Evaluate the things you see, the things you hear, and the things you read. Then you decide on what you
        must do. Rather than following what is common, spend some time thinking about other possible ways.</li>
    <li>Always consider motives. Everyone has a motive and bias; hence, you should always consider where the information
        is coming from and who is the one giving it.

    <li>ere the information is coming from and who is the one giving it.
        Research. To be more believable and realistic, learn to do some research. Learning about a scenario or situation
        beforehand helps in making decisions with ease and confidence.</li>
    <li>Make it a habit to always ask questions. It helps to be more informed. Do not be afraid to ask questions to
        those who know, especially when you badly need information or just need to know things.</li>
    <li>Never assume that you are right. Assuming that you are right without consideration for other point of views is
        not grounds for thinking critically. You should be open to new ideas and opinions.
    </li>
    <li>Break things down. Problems might look big and difficult to solve at first glance. However, if you can break it
        down to smaller chunks, they will be easier to manage.</li>
    <li>Keep things simple. Always go for the simplest explanation that fits all facts.</li>
    </ol>
